So, the 40th president would be the 40th person to hold the office.\n\nI think about the sequence of presidents I know:\n- George Washington was the first.\n- Then comes John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and so on.\n- Moving forward in history, I recall that Ronald Reagan was president in the 1980s.\n\nBut to be precise, I need to think about the exact order. I know that Jimmy Carter was the 39th president, serving from 1977 to 1981. Therefore, the next president, who would be the 40th, would be Ronald Reagan, who served from 1981 to 1989.\n\nBut just to double-check, I recall that before Carter, Gerald Ford was president, but he was not elected; he became president after Richard Nixon resigned. Ford was the 38th president, and Carter was the 39th. So, Reagan indeed follows Carter as the 40th president.\n\nBut wait, I think there might be a mistake here. I recall that Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted as both the 22nd and 24th president. So the numbering might not be straightforward.\n\nBut in the case of Reagan, I'm pretty sure he is the 40th president. To confirm, I think about the list of presidents after Carter:\n1. Ronald Reagan (1981-1989)\n2. George H.W. Bush (1989-1993)\n3. Bill Clinton (1993-2001)\n4. George W. Bush (2001-2009)\n5. Barack Obama (2009-2017)\n6. Donald Trump (2017-2021)\n7. Joe Biden (2021-present)\n\nBut counting back, if Carter was 39th, then Reagan would indeed be the 40th.\n\nBut to be thorough, I recall that the list of presidents is as follows (partial list for brevity):\n...\n38. Gerald Ford (1974-1977)\n39. Jimmy Carter (1977-1981)\n40. Ronald Reagan (1981-1989)\n...\n\nYes, that matches my previous thought. So Ronald Reagan is indeed the 40th president of the USA.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, I recall that sometimes presidents who served non-consecutive terms are counted twice, but that's not the case here since Reagan served two consecutive terms.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the 40th president of the USA is Ronald Reagan.", type='text')], closed=None, type='thinking'), TextChunk(text='The 40th president of the USA is Ronald Reagan.', type='text')]
