But I need to be precise about the order.\n\nI recall that Ronald Reagan was a significant figure in the late 20th century. He served two terms, which would make him the 40th president if the numbering aligns correctly.\n\nBut to be sure, let me try to list some presidents and their numbers to see if Reagan fits as the 40th:\n\n- George Washington was the 1st president.\n- John Adams was the 2nd.\n- ...\n- Franklin D.

But overall, the sequence should still hold because he is counted twice. So, the total count should still be accurate.\n\nLet me verify with a more recent president to ensure accuracy. For example, I know that Joe Biden is the 46th president. If Reagan was the 40th, then the sequence would be:\n\n40. Ronald Reagan (1981-1989)\n41. George H.W. Bush (1989-1993)\n42.
